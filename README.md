the map will contain obstacles,  places where movement is not possible,   will contain a graphical interface in which the map and, in appropriate colours of your choice, the obstacles, starting position, final position and route will be displayed. The graphical interface will also contain appropriate components by means of which the user can switch between the states of defining obstacles, defining starting position and defining final position. It would be interesting for the map to represent some external environment, with roads, lakes, hills, mountains, houses, etc. The movement could have the following indicative costs : from the road (1), over a meadow (2), through a forest (3), up a hill (3-5) depending on the height, up a mountain (3-10) depending on the height, over a lake (e.g. by boat), (5).  A second map contains various objects and areas that attract or repel the user, spread an aura of increased "cost" around them that wears off as we move away from the object. The areas that cause repulsion are diffused by the same increased cost. Conversely, objects that cause attraction diffuse an aura of reduced "cost" around them that wears off as we move away from the object . The areas that cause attraction are diffused by the same reduced cost.
